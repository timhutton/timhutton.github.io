I met her in a feminist squat in 1975 near Regents Park. I didn&#39;t like her, even though I liked and supported feminists at the time and made tea for them when they visited, Melanie Phillips was a vicious, critical, inhumane Stalinist feminist, a sexist bully, a ranter and a right old pain in the arse even then. I know many women who knew her then and didn&#39;t like her very much either, and this was at a time when criticising a &#39;sister&#39; to a man was almost criminal.<br>But today, fool that I am I had to do it. Sit on my chair, grip the seat and read through Melanie Philips turgid dross on the Daily Fail. I won&#39;t post a link, if you want to you can find it. She harps on and on about the &#39;liberal intelligentsia&#39; being the direct cause of the recent riots. It&#39;s because of hate filled feminists like Harriet Harman who deliberately set about destroying the nuclear family etc etc. According to the repugnant harridan that scrawled this reactionary dross, kids are rioting because they don&#39;t have fathers, because the labour party forced people to be single parents, she then uses a bit of half baked Freudian analysis about male rage. Every single broken window, stolen telly and burnt out car/shop/house is directly the result of the Labour party. <br>This hate filled, twisted nightmare of a woman has an enormous readership and all around the suburbs of this country today people will be absorbing this distorted gobbledegook and nodding wisely. It&#39;s not us at fault they will say, it&#39;s those wretched lefty liberals and their absurd notion that the very normal, level headed society we live in is to blame.<br>Strangely she doesn&#39;t quote her own paper which, in March last year, ran with the story that the gap between the rich and poor in the UK is bigger now than it was during the era of slavery 200 years ago. The gap started to widen in the late 1970&#39;s, I know, I was there. This gap was levered in by, strangely, not the liberal intelligentsia, but by right wing moralists and the uber capitalist bullies who funded them discreetly, people like, um, like Melanie Philips. <br>The de-regulation of the banking industry under the Thatcher government resulted in the mind numbingly short sighted foolery of the last 25 years, where terms like &#39;fiscal growth&#39; and &#39;free market economy&#39; leached into our every day lives. Where &#39;the city&#39; became the focal point of our culture, where the dullest people on earth, the least creative, most stupid and greedy morons we have ever spawned because totems of our respect. Bankers. Ghastly men who drive stupid cars and pontificate about the economy, and all they did was screw it up for the rest of us, and then we, the poor, stupid, dumb tax payers gave them a load more money.<br>I wonder why young people are so stupid, short sighted and greedy. Oh wait, it&#39;s the &#39;liberal intelligentsia&#39; telling them to be like that.<br>The moral lead they&#39;ve been fed for the past 30 years, as exemplified by endless streams of financial specialists, banking pundits and free marketeers is &#39;you can fiddle, steal and lie your way to wealth like we do.&#39;<br>Well, they have, and none of us like it.<br>The Daily Mail also ran a story last year about the growing &#39;underclass&#39; of disenfranchised kids who had sod all to look forward to, who didn&#39;t fit into the very narrow avenues of &#39;opportunity&#39; that are supposed to exist, who are marginalised, harassed and pushed aside by the law breaking, non tax paying, phone hacking, spray tanned super rich.<br>We are all responsible for the riots, me, you, Thatcher, Major, Blair, Brown and the Cameron bloke, the Labour party, the Tory party, the Lib Dems, right wing bigots and left wing whiners. We have allowed our society to be ruled by a super elite who live offshore, don&#39;t pay tax, have the power and money to lobby governments and &#39;adjust&#39; legislation to suit their goals. <br>But two faced Phillips, an old lefty feminist blames it all on the  &#39;liberal intelligentsia&#39; of whom she was once a prime member. As we all know, there is no greater anti smoker than someone who is an ex-smoker. Who the hell is the &#39;liberal intelligentsia&#39; anyway? Stephen Fry? Definitely not me, I&#39;m thick.</div></div><div class="visibility">Shared with: Public</div><div class="post-activity"><div class="plus-oners">+1'd by: <a href="https://plus.google.com/115457939124184448724">Steve Grand</a></div></div></body></html>

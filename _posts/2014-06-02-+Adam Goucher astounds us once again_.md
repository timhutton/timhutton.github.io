Proving associativity is possible with a lovely theorem called Cayley-Bacharach.



In my elliptic curve calculator, I have used @ to emulate multiplication. Division is rather routine, since it’s just reverse-engineering multiplication. Finding the point B with a tangent intersecting the curve at A is equivalent to solving A @ B @ B = e, so B is the square root of the reciprocal of A.

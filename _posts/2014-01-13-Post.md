I taught her how to solder when she was 9 and now she owns a website documenting her robotics projects, mostly open source. She&#39;s being accepted (fingers crossed) to one of the most prestigious schools in North America and it warms my heart to know that her parents care so much about her future that they shuttled her around LA the past few years to learn as much from my robot nerds and I as humanly possible as neither of them know the slightest thing about engineering. She was my guest at Loscon, gave a presentation on &quot;Girls and Robots&quot;, and spoke on the &quot;Arduino&quot; and &quot;Women in STEM&quot; panels with me. <br><br>PARENTS!!! If your child asks for tools to become successful, give them everything they need and more. Teach them how to use the Internet, forums and YouTube to learn everything and never ever ever tell them something they enjoy isn&#39;t appropriate because of their gender. <br><br>Here&#39;s a picture of us, 2 weeks after the first time I taught her to solder, inspecting her joints.

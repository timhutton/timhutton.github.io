After killing the nest with the poison dust we plugged up the outside holes and left it. All was quiet until about a week later we noticed 10 dead wasps inside the room. The eggs in the nest must have hatched and then the baby wasps, finding themselves surrounded by dead parents and desolation, chewed through the plasterboard looking for revenge. More dusting (from the inside this time) and it has all gone quiet again. For now.</div></div></div></body></html>

<div class="entry-item s2-entrytext">I've just <a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/askslashdot/07/09/07/1242212.shtml" rel="nofollow">found out</a> that Unix has a useful little command called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_(Unix)" rel="nofollow"><b>yes</b></a>. It's perfect for when a pesky program keeps asking you for confirmation: "do you want to delete this file? (yes) do you want to delete this directory? (yes)" - simply call the program using <b>yes</b> and it will answer yes to all these questions for you automatically, therefore representing technologyâ€™s greatest triumph to date over both itself and plain common sense.
